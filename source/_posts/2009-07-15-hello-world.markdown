Welcome to my blog. I'm only about 10 years behind the times, but better late
than never I suppose. In my defense, the need for a place for musings and
information too long for Twitter ([@josephruscio](http://twitter.com/josephruscio))
served as the main motivator.
Look in this space for intermittent postings on software development, computer
science, startupping, marathon training, food/drink, or whatever other shiny
object has my attention.
